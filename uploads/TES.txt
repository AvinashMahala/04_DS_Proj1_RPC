server.py

The code provided is a server-side implementation using Pyro4 for file synchronization and computation operations. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Imports: The necessary modules are imported, including os for file operations, Pyro4 for remote object communication, threading for thread 	management, time for time-related operations, traceback for error traceback, and base64 for encoding and decoding file data.

2. Constants: The UPLOADS_FOLDER and SYNC_FOLDER constants define the names of the folders for file uploads and synchronization.

3. FileServer class: This class represents the file server and handles file-related operations.





4. Constructor: Initializes the file server by creating the necessary folders (UPLOADS_FOLDER and SYNC_FOLDER) if they don't exist.

5. File operations: The upload, download, delete, and rename methods handle the corresponding file operations. They receive the file name and perform the operation on the file in the UPLOADS_FOLDER.

6. List files: The list_files method returns a list of files in the UPLOADS_FOLDER.

7. Get last modified: The get_last_modified method retrieves the last modified timestamp of a file in the SYNC_FOLDER.

8. ComputationServer class: This class represents the computation server and provides some basic computation operations.

9. Add and Sort: The add and sort methods perform addition and sorting operations, respectively, on input data.
Daemon and Registration: The Pyro4 daemon is created, and the file server and computation server objects are registered with the Pyro name server (ns). The registered objects are given names (file.server and computation.server) to be accessed by the client.

10. Server Execution: The server starts running in the daemon.requestLoop() method. Any exceptions that occur during the server execution are caught, printed, and the server is shut down.
